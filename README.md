# Background
Callacon is a bi-annual gaming convention organised by a group of friends. It has been running for about 20 years, and holds Gaming 'Weekends' twice a year, in Matlock, Derbyshire.  

Historically, all of the organisation has been undertaken by a single person, but over the last year or so a committee has been formed to spread the workload.  

There are about 50 attendees to each event, and an appropriate number of holiday cottages are booked and paid for centrally through the Gaming Weekend account. Costs are then recovered from attendees.

In addition, games are pitched by GMs, and need to be scheduled.

This project seeks to provide a bespoke website for the committee, making it easier to organise the various aspects of the gaming weekend.
